Float Moodle is a website which provides services to its users. Some of it's important features include: 
## Signup
- The website requires authentication, so When a user visits the home page and want to create an account, then they must use the SignUp option. It redirects us to the **Signup** portal, where user can create an account.
- Here we can choose a username of our interest within 150 characters and also create a password for this username following certain protocols like having atleast 8 characters, not entirely numeric etc for security reasons.
   
## Login
- Once an account is created we can use those credentials to login into our account and on succesful login, We can see the **Dashboard** page.

## Dashboard
- After we login in to the website we can see our dashboard and it contains the User **Profile**.
- We have the options of **Editing** our profile and we also have an option for **changing password**.
- We also have links to **Courses** page as well as the **Chat** page.

  
## Courses
- Here We can **create** a course or **join** a course either as a **student** or a **TA**.
- After creating a course, 2 codes will be generated randomly, one for TA's and other for students to join.
- We can use these **codes** to join the course as a student or a TA.
- An icon is created for each of our course, and it has a symbol on the top **square/circle/triangle**, indicating whether you are a Instructor/Student/TA in that course respectively.
- And each course icon has a **Progress Bar**  indicating the **percentage of course** activities that are finished.
- For students it indicates the percentage of assignments that are finished and for instructors it indicates the percentage of assignments that are graded by them.
- There is also a **TO-DO** list present on the right side which reminds us of our incomplete activities of **pending Submission** or assignments **to be Graded** in all our Courses.
